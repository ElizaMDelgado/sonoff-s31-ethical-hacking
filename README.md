# Sonoff S31 Ethical Hacking Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the documentation, scripts, and findings from an ethical hacking project targeting the Sonoff S31 smart plug. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, test local APIs, and explore mitigation strategies.

## 🧪 Project Goals
- Analyze local API vulnerabilities
- Test unauthenticated access and fuzz inputs
- Explore firmware and hardware interfaces (UART, OTA)
- Propose remediations or hardening techniques

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python + requests
- Burp Suite (for HTTP fuzzing)
- Tasmota firmware
- Serial UART adapter
- curl, tcpdump, Wireshark

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is for **educational purposes only**. The Sonoff S31 was tested in a lab environment owned by the researcher.
